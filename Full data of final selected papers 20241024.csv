However, during the design stage, assessing the station areas' performance, of which user satisfaction is indicative, is challenging due to methodological limitations. Agent-based simulation (ABS) is promising as it can link spatial features with agents' behavior features. This research questions to what extent ABS can help assess the urban design of station areas. Methods: This paper adopts the user pyramid as the theoretical framework, which outlines five types of user needs: safety, speed, ease, comfort, and experience. The paper selects indicators linking satisfaction and spatial features at the district and building levels. These indicators are measured in the simulation of the station system using digital tools, including MassMotion and Python scripts. The theory, indicators, and tools, in combination, serve as an assessment framework. Rotterdam Central Station is used as a case to demonstrate how the framework works. Results: The framework is capable of assessing design alternatives by identifying changes in user satisfaction. It can be applied on the district level (at a scale of 250 m) with substantial details to inform design decision-making, and it is useful during the design stage when only limited data is available. This paper strengthens the scientific knowledge of railway station areas through the multidisciplinary literature review that translates user needs for urban design use, and it advances the digital means to visualize user satisfaction affected by design. © 2024","Crowd simulation; Environmental psychology; Mapping; Vision analysis","Architectural design; Subway stations; Urban growth; Agent based simulation; Crowd Simulation; Design stage; Environmental psychology; Railway stations; Spatial features; Urban design; User need; Users' satisfactions; Vision analyze; Digital elevation model; literature review; mapping method; sustainable development; urban design; vision; Netherlands; Rotterdam; South Holland",,,,,"China Scholarship Council, CSC: 202106260022","This work was supported by the China Scholarship Council (CSC) [202106260022].",,,"Anthony, D., Frank, A., Station Design Guidance Design Manual NR/GN/CIV/100/02 (2021); Arthur, P., Passini, R., Wayfinding: People, Signs, and Architecture (1989), 1st ed McGraw-Hill New York; Benedikt, M.L., To take hold of space: Isovists and isovist fields (1979) Environ.

Traditional methods for crowd management often rely on empirical knowledge, which has limitations in quickly grasping the on-site situation and making decisions on the spot. In this study, we developed a real-time crowd flow prediction and visualization platform incorporating an agent-based crowd simulation and an advanced crowd management system called crowd management platform as a service. In a case study focused on the area around the Tokyo Dome, we demonstrated that capturing pedestrian flow allows for accurate predictions of congestion at the nearest train station up to 10 min in advance. Moreover, the time required to predict the situation 20 min ahead for 3,000 agents was 1 min and 35 s, confirming the feasibility of real-time processing. To enhance the accuracy and reliability of the simulation results, a sensitivity analysis considering errors in pedestrian flow measurement revealed that simple linear models cannot capture the complexity of crowd dynamics adequately. Notably, the agent-based simulation replicated stop-and-go wave patterns observed in actual measurements under specific crowd conditions, confirming the advantage of using agent-based simulations. Finally, we proposed a method that enables facility managers and security personnel to conduct a more comprehensive evaluation. This method integrates their existing experience with the aggregated display of multiple simulation results, which includes consideration of errors in pedestrian flow measurement through a visualization platform. © Fuji Technology Press Ltd.","crowd flow prediction; crowd managemenagent-based simulation; visualization","Flow measurement; Forecasting; Human resource management; Reliability analysis; Sensitivity analysis; Agent based simulation; Crowd flow prediction; Crowd flows; Crowd managemenagent-based simulation; Crowd managements; Flow prediction; Flow visualisation; Pedestrian flow; Real- time; Visualization platforms; Visualization",,,,,"JST-Mirai Program: JPMJMI20D1; Japan Society for the Promotion of Science, JSPS: JP22H01664","This work was supported by the JST-Mirai Program Grant Number JPMJMI20D1 and JSPS KAKENHI Grant Number JP22H01664.",,,"Feliciani, C., Shimura, K., Nishinari, K., (2021) Introduction to Crowd Management: Managing Crowds in the Digital Era: Theory and Practice, , https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-03090012-0, [1] Springer; Sidiropoulos, G., Kiourt, C., Moussiades, L., Crowd simulation for crisis management: The outcomes of the last decade (2020) Machine Learning with Applications, 2, p. 100009. , https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mlwa.2020.100009, Articl; Simonov, A., Lebin, A., Shcherbak, B., Zagarskikh, A., Karsakov, A., Multi-agent crowd simulation on large areas with utilitybased behavior models: Sochi Olympic Park Station use case (2018) Procedia Computer Science, 136, pp. 453-462. , https://doi.org/10.1016/j.procs.2018.08.266; Sindagi, V.

Achieving a robust quantitative understanding of pedestrian behavior in these facilities is a key societal necessity. What makes this an outstanding scientific challenge is the extreme randomness intrinsic to pedestrian behavior. Any quantitative understanding necessarily needs to be probabilistic, including average dynamics and fluctuations. To this purpose, large-scale, real-life trajectory datasets are paramount. In this work, we analyze the data from an unprecedentedly high statistics year-long pedestrian tracking campaign, in which we anonymously collected millions of trajectories of pedestrians ascending and descending stairs within Eindhoven Central train station (The Netherlands). This has been possible thanks to a state-of-the-art, faster than real-time, computer vision approach hinged on 3D depth imaging, sensor fusion, and YOLOv7-based depth localization. We consider both free-stream conditions, i.e. pedestrians walking in undisturbed, and trafficked conditions, unidirectional/bidirectional flows. We report on Eulerian fields (density, velocity and acceleration), showing how the walking dynamics changes when transitioning from stairs to landing. We then investigate the (mutual) positions of pedestrian as density changes, considering the crowd as a “compressible” physical medium. In particular, we show how pedestrians willingly opt to occupy fewer space than available, accepting a certain degree of compressibility. This is a non-trivial physical feature of pedestrian dynamics and we introduce a novel way to quantify this effect. As density increases, pedestrians strive to keep a minimum distance d≈0.6m (two treads of the staircase) from the person in front of them. Finally, we establish first-of-kind fully resolved probabilistic fundamental diagrams, where we model the pedestrian walking velocity as a mixture of a slow and fast-paced component (both in non-negligible percentages and with density-dependent characteristic fluctuations). Notably, averages and modes of velocity distribution turn out to be substantially different. Our results, of which we include probabilistic parametrizations based on few variables, are key towards improved facility design and realistic simulation of pedestrians on staircases. © 2024 The Authors","Compressibility and space occupancy; Crowd dynamics on stairways; Eulerian fields; High-statistics trajectory dataset; Probabilistic fundamental diagrams; Real-time pedestrian tracking","Acceleration; Compressibility; Dynamics; Graphic methods; Large dataset; Office buildings; Stairs; Velocity distribution; Compressibility and space occupancy; Crowd dynamic on stairway; Crowd dynamics; Eulerian field; Fundamental diagram; High-statistic trajectory dataset; Pedestrian tracking; Probabilistic fundamental diagram; Probabilistics; Real- time; Real-time pedestrian tracking; Trajectories; compressibility; Eulerian analysis; numerical model; pedestrian; probability; transportation development; transportation planning; Netherlands",,,,,"17962; Nederlandse Organisatie voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek, NWO","This work is supported by the HTSM research program “HTCrowd: a high-tech platform for human crowd flows monitoring, modeling and nudging” with project number 17962 , financed by the Dutch Research Council (NWO), The Netherlands .

However, due to the complexity and randomness of passenger flow and the unclear spatial-temporal correlation between functional areas within the station, predicting the spatiotemporal distribution dynamics of inflow and future short-term distribution trends is challenging. Emerging deep learning models offer valuable insights for accurately predicting passenger flow distribution. Thus, we propose a deep learning architecture, named ""ST-Bi-LSTM,""which combines a bidirectional long short-term memory network with a spatial-temporal attention mechanism. Initially, we outline the methodologies of Bi-LSTM, the DeepWalk-based spatial attention mechanism, and the temporal attention mechanism. The spatial attention mechanism is employed to extract station spatial network topology information and enhance the representation of passenger flow characteristics in highly correlated areas during the forecasting process. Simultaneously, the temporal attention Bi-LSTM is utilized for capturing temporal correlations. The architecture comprises four branches dedicated to station real-time video monitoring data, spatial network topology, function area attributes, and train timetables. Subsequently, leveraging in-station CCTV data, passenger travel behavior data, and train timetables, we apply the architecture to the Tianjin West High-Speed Railway Station. We conduct a comparative analysis of the prediction performance and time complexity of the proposed architecture against existing baseline models, demonstrating superior performance and robustness exhibited by the ST-Bi-LSTM model (achieving a reduction in RMSE of over 10%). This study facilitates the transition of station management from passive response to active prediction of station passenger flow dynamics. © 2024 Zhicheng Dai et al.",,"Complex networks; Forecasting;

However, empirical evidence on the connection between the intensity of social interaction and outdoor public spaces is still lacking. Applying machine learning algorithms to a 9-hour time-lapse video of an urban park, we decipher the effects of two spatial features, edges, and landmarks, on visitors’ activities. We identified dynamic visitor groups in the videos through a graph-based method and mapped the clustering pattern of interaction activities over time and space. In parallel, we used a computer vision algorithm to delineate fixed objects (notably the harbourfront, landside park boundary, a carousel, four benches, three pavilions, and four heart-shaped seating) and dynamic edges (formed by moveable furniture as park visitors repositioned them) onsite. We found that dynamic edges formed by moveable furniture and the fixed edge of a visual landmark consistently attracted more social interaction and group activities. In designing public spaces that encourage group activities, urban planners and designers can leverage the combination of fixed objects and flexible furniture to maximise the choices for visitors and curate a more engaging public open space. © The Author(s) 2023.","Computer vision; public space; social interaction; spatial configuration","computer vision; open space; public space; social behavior; spatial analysis; videography",,,,,"University Grants Committee, UGC: GRF17616221; Guangdong Science and Technology Department, GDSTC: 2020B1212030009; Science and Technology Department of Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region","The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This work was supported by the University Grants Committee (GRF17616221) and the 2020 Guangdong New Innovative Strategic Research Fund (Project No.: 2020B1212030009).","The authors would like to thank the Harbour Office for sharing the video with the research team.

However, the choice of waiting places and the resulting spatial distribution of the crowd have rarely been studied. This study investigates the effects of obstacles, number of passengers and waiting time on the distribution of waiting passengers. Laboratory experiments were performed using a mock-up platform with three set-ups: without obstacles, with a narrow and a wide obstacle. Density profiles determine preferred waiting places. While the space usage by waiting passengers is inhomogeneous, the distances between the individuals show surprisingly small variations, regardless of obstacles and number of passengers. This suggests a robust collective optimization of the crowd when searching for waiting positions. In doing so, and without necessity, the participants chose distances to each other extending into the personal zone specified in classical personal-space-concepts. These results indicate necessary refinements of the concept by considering context and collective behaviour. The findings are transformed into floor-fields modelling the space usage by a superposition of attractive or repulsive areas which consider optimization of distances and comfort. This model does not only reproduce the waiting places at platforms but can be adapted for other use cases. © 2023 The Author(s)","experiment; pedestrian; train station; waiting","Laboratory experiments; Mock up; Optimisations; Pedestrian; Performance; Railway platforms; Space usage; Train stations; Waiting; Waiting time; Spatial distribution; adult; article; comfort; human; pedestrian; personal space; hospital admission; Humans; Pedestrians; Waiting Lists",,,,,"Bundesministerium für Bildung und Forschung, BMBF: 13N14530, 13N14533","The study was part of the project ‘CroMa–Crowd Management in Verkehrsinfrastrukturen’.

The “plug-in design” targets sustainable regeneration while preserving the overall urban texture and context, i.e., it has little impact on the spatial qualities of the old city. The ultimate goal is to activate the public space of the old city of Guangzhou point to area through the insertion of various plug-ins. In this study, the methodology is applied to Xudi Gaodi Street, the core area of the old city of Guangzhou, to explore its effects on sustainability. The internal public space is isolated and supplied with rigid and flexible plug-ins from multiple dimensions, which not only improves the spatial environment but also injects new urban formats. This work provides a specific solution for regeneration in Guangzhou’s old city while enhancing empirical knowledge of the plug-in design to support urban regeneration theory and further practical development. © 2023 by the authors.","old city regeneration; plug-in design; public space; sustainability; Xudi-Gaodijie area","public space; spatial analysis; sustainability; urban area; urban design; urban renewal; China; Guangdong; Guangzhou",,,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC: 51978267, x2jz/C9238012; South China University of Technology, SCUT","1.

Guiding arriving fans along less traveled routes may alleviate congestion. Smartphone apps provide a medium to deliver route suggestions but the messages they provide are pivotal to adherence. We explore how message design affects pedestrians’ willingness to follow route instructions. We present an online survey conducted with two groups: football fans, and students and faculty associates. We vary the presence of top down views of the route choices at train station Münchner Freiheit in Munich, real-time information on congestion, and appeals to team spirit. We compute a distribution of route choices that suggests that congestion may be reduced with the right combination of message components for each target group. We then use a computer simulation to investigate the congestion situation. Our results suggest that lowest congestion is achieved when people base their decisions on real-time information. The social identity approach is highlighted in our study as having a possible influence on message design. Moreover, it indicates that the implementation of such apps in real-life applications can improve safety. Our methodology can be applied to other scenarios to test the suitability of apps and message designs. Copyright: © 2023 Mayr et al.

Conventional crowd congestion monitoring using closed-circuit television (CCTV) video surveillance relies on manual observation, which is tedious and often error-prone in public urban spaces where crowds are dense, and occlusions are prominent. With the aim of managing crowded spaces safely, this study proposes a framework that combines spatial and temporal information to automatically map the trajectories of individual occupants, as well as to assist in real-time congestion monitoring and prediction. Through exploiting both features from CCTV footage and spatial information of the public space, the framework fuses raw CCTV video and floor plan information to create visual aids for crowd monitoring, as well as a sequence of crowd mobility graphs (CMGraphs) to store spatiotemporal features. This framework uses deep learning-based computer vision models, geometric transformations, and Kalman filter-based tracking algorithms to automate the retrieval of crowd congestion data, specifically the spatiotemporal distribution of individuals and the overall crowd flow. The resulting collective crowd movement data is then stored in the CMGraphs, which are designed to facilitate congestion forecasting at key exit/entry regions. We demonstrate our framework on two video data, one public from a train station dataset and the other recorded at a stadium following a crowded football game. Using both qualitative and quantitative insights from the experiments, we demonstrate that the suggested framework can be useful to help assist urban planners and infrastructure operators with the management of congestion hazards. © 2023 by the authors.","computer vision; crowd congestion; deep learning; graph representation learning","Deep learning; Learning systems; Security systems; Urban planning; Closed circuit television; Crowd congestion; Deep learning; Graph representation; Graph representation learning; Mobility graphs; Public safety; Spatial informations; Urban spaces; Video information; Computer vision",,,,,,"The research is supported by the Stanford Center at the Incheon Global Campus (SCIGC), which is sponsored in part under the National Program to Subsidize Attracting Foreign Educational Institution and Research Institutes published by the Ministry of Trade, Industry, and Energy of the Republic of Korea and managed by the Incheon Free Economic Zone Authority.",,,"Wang, J., Ding, Y.N., Liu, D.D., The Research on Early Warning of Preventing the Stampede on Crowded Places and Evacuated Technology (2015) Proceedings of the 2015 International Forum on Energy, Environment Science and Materials, pp. 1544-1551. , Shenzhen, China, 25–26 September 2015, Atlantis Press, Paris, France; Sindagi, V.A., Patel, V.M., A Survey of Recent Advances in CNN-Based Single Image Crowd Counting and Density Estimation (2018) Pattern Recognit.

One of the temporary architectures that offer high flexibility is the tent. Despite often being underestimated or not entirely accepted as architecture, its adaptability has opened up opportunities for a new idea of elasticity and plasticity in this contemporary era. This research searches to question the stagnant paradigm by reinvestigating its temporal character. History- and theory-based bibliography methods are used to stimulate the informal meaning of the tent. The result is the concept actualization of contemporary tent architecture. The findings are a different perspective of nomadism, the tent’s simple concept, and a multi-dimensional tent’s scale. The novelty of the research is the new meaning of tents as a type of contemporary informal architecture. © The Author(s) 2023.","architecture; concept; meaning; temporary; tent",,,,,,,,,,"Agudin, L.M., (1995) The concept of type in architecture: An inquiry into the nature of architectural form [Dissertation ETH No. 11115], , The Swiss Federal Institute of Technology; Alatorre, F.J., Are tent cities an illusion of success?

These heavy pedestrian traffic flows may cause congestion or crowd accidents. As a result, the national government and railroad companies in Japan are evaluating various countermeasures against railroad station congestion. In this study, we accordingly conducted a field survey to observe the flowing and stationary people in front of the ticket gates at a railroad station. Based on the data gathered by this survey, we constructed an agent-based model to simulate the movement of flowing people through the train station concourse according to the time of day, number of stationary people present, and ticket gate directional restrictions. The simulation results confirmed that the congestion in front of the ticket gates, indicated by the time required to pass through the concourse, was affected by the number and direction of flowing people, number and location of stationary people, and ticket gate directional restrictions. The implementation of an intentional pedestrian flow pattern effectively shortened the walking time of the flowing people in the concourse, thus easing congestion. © 2022 The Author(s).

Congestion is observed at subway, bus, and train stations nearby the sports venues by the end of every competition. We propose two techniques for crowd-control around large sports events. We use Augmented Reality(AR) technology and hand gestures detecting wearable devices for two purposes. First, post-event congestion peak avoidance at the nearest station by passengers' arrival rate reduction. Attraction spots, where fans can enjoy secondary activities such as remote-sightseeing using VR, can be established in arbitrary locations around the venue. This is to postpone some fans' arrival at the nearest station and to encourage walking towards another nearby one. Second, accelerating the inside-station trip to increase passengers' departure rate. Fans moving in groups can use the wearable device and the coupled smartphone application for intra-station navigation and quick way-finding while avoiding getting separated by the crowds. We also present two agent-based simulations to indicate the efficacy of both techniques in mitigating stations overcrowding. The evaluation shows that providing attraction spots reduced fans' arrival at the nearest station to the event and the arrival rates at all stations. Moreover, the navigation of large-size groups was enhanced in crowded stations. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","agent-based simulation; group navigation-support; Mitigating crowded stations; secondary activities; wearable device","Augmented reality; Sports; Traffic congestion; Wearable technology; Agent based simulation; Arrival rates; Group navigation; Group navigation-support; Mitigating crowded station; Navigation support; Secondary activity; Sports events; Transportation terminal; Wearable devices; Navigation",,,,,,,,,"Ahn, S., Hutchison, D.F., Jones, L.F., Kundu, R., Lam, W., (2017), Evaluating the Impact of Improvement of Wayfinding at a Train Station: Agent-Based Simulation Study; Bajic, V., The Effects of a New Subway Line on Housing Prices in Metropolitan Toronto (1983) Urban Studies, 20 (2), pp. 147-158; Bañgate, J., Dugdale, J., Beck, E., Adam, C., (2019), A Multi-Agent System Approach Evaluating Human Spatio-Temporal Vulnerability to Seismic Risk Using Social Attachment.

Although it is increasingly feasible to move space-defining objects like room dividers by mobile robots, little is known about how or when such spatial adaptations should occur. We therefore measured the experience of 26 occupants while they performed six different activities inside an office breakout room that was being adapted by a robotically moving wall in either a reactive or proactive way. Based on these empirical findings, we propose how autonomous spatial adaptation should primarily aim to balance the spatial, situational and subjective qualities of the resulting sense of place. We also define eight distinct design recommendations that exploit the unique affordances of spatial adaptation. By asserting that future advances in human-building interaction (HBI) should be based on creating appropriate places rather than controlling functional spaces, we foresee how responsive architecture might become as compelling as its static counterpart. © 2022 ACM.","adaptive architecture; human-building interaction; human-robot interaction; interactive architecture; kinetic architecture; place-making; responsive architecture; robotic architecture; robotic furniture; robotic wall; sense of place; smart building; smart office; smart space; spatial layout","Architecture; Walls (structural partitions); Adaptive architecture; Human-building interaction; Humans-robot interactions; Interactive architecture; Kinetic architectures; Place-making; Responsive architecture; Robotic furniture; Robotic wall; Robotics architecture; Sense of place; Smart offices; Smart space; Spatial layout; Human robot interaction",,,,,,"The research reported in this paper is funded by grant CELSA/18/020 titled ""Purposefully Controlling Mediated Architecture"".

They can move, rotate, flip and perform various physical gestures. This paper aims to explore the spatial, aesthetical, and technical characteristics of kinetic buildings within the framework of the theory of tectonics, which is still far away from covering the art form of movement. The study has been organized into two phases. The first phase sets up the theoretical framework of the topic by exploring the main dichotomy of the tectonic discourse on “ontological and representational parts of the building” and introduces the main concepts of kinetic architecture related to the characterization of architectural space. The second phase is a case study on The Shed as also known as Culture Shed in Hudson Yards in New York City. This part focuses on the interrelations between tectonics and the physical movement of architectural elements. The results indicate that the type of movement and the role of moving elements change not only the architectural space but also the tectonic character of the building. While some movements and moving parts are directly related to the representational aspects, some change the ontological character of the building. The impact of the movement on the tectonic character is a topic that hasn't been well investigated yet and has the potential to be developed through further research. As a result, the theoretical findings of this study can contribute to tectonic thinking during the design process of kinetic architectural products.

This paper proposes a novel model that can be used to accurately analyze the crowd stability based on images obtained from a real-time video surveillance system (VSS) in dense crowd scenarios. To enhance the accuracy of the human head recognition for the crowd counting and crowd density estimation, we improve the conventional convolution-neural-network (CNN) model with more columns and merged features, obtaining a four-column convolutional neural network (4C-CNN). Using more columns with receptive fields of deferent sizes, more merged features can be learned, to be adaptive to variations in pedestrian head size due to image resolution. Furthermore, the crowd density of different areas is calculated with image rectification against the perspective distortion. By utilizing the stability criterion based on crowd density, we propose a crowd stability analysis model (CSAM) with the capability of quantitative computation dynamically. The results of extensive experiments performed on public datasets indicate that this improved CNN model exhibits a better performance for crowd counting than the typical multi-column CNN models. In addition, the experiment results pertaining to Shanghai Hongqiao Railway Station demonstrate the effectiveness of the crowd stability analysis model. Thus, this integrated approach can simultaneously conduct the processes of crowd counting, image rectification, density map calculation and crowd stability analysis by using dense crowd images from a VSS. © 2000-2011 IEEE.","Convolutional neural network; crowd count; crowd density; crowd stability analysis; image rectification","Convolution; Convolutional neural networks; Image analysis; Image resolution; Security systems; Stability criteria; Convolution neural network; Image rectification; Integrated approach; Perspective distortion; Quantitative information; Real time video surveillances; Receptive fields; Stability analysis; Image enhancement",,,,,,,,,"Marana, A.N., Da Fontoura Costa, L., Lotufo, R.A., Velastin, S.A., Estimating crowd density with minkowski fractal dimension (1999) Proc.

Both analytical and simulation methods have been used to analyse complex station areas; however, prior efforts have only focused on either train or pedestrian movements with over-simplified assumptions that do not properly capture the impact of their interaction on capacity. This study applies an integrated crowd and transit simulation platform “Nexus” to simultaneously study the impact of pedestrian and train movements on the system performance of a complex railway station. Unlike other methods such as sequential simulation methods, the integrated simulation platform permits linkage between commercial-grade simulators. Instead of treating each simulator separately, this integrated method enables detailed modelling of how the train and crowd dynamic interact at station platforms. Such integration aims to explore the interactive effect on both types of movement and enable performance analysis possible only through this combination. To validate the model, a case study is performed on Toronto’s Union Station. Extensive data were collected, processed and input into railway and pedestrian models constructed using OpenTrack and MassMotion, respectively, and integrated via Nexus. Examining scenarios of increased levels of train and passenger volumes, a 9% drop in on-time performance of train operation is observed, while the level of service experienced by passengers on the platform deteriorates significantly due to crowding. Both length and variation in dwell time due to pedestrian movement are recognized as the main factors of performance deterioration, especially when the system approaches capacity limit. The simulation model produces estimates of the practical track-side capacity of the station and associated platform crowding levels, and helps identify locations where passengers experience severe overcrowding, which are not easily obtainable from mathematical models. © 2022, The Author(s).","Dwell time; Pedestrian simulation; Rail operations; Rail simulation; Station capacity",,,,,,,"The authors would like to thank the anonymous reviewers for their helpful comments and feedback.",,,"Abril, M., Barber, F., Ingolotti, L., Salido, M.A., Tormos, P., Lova, A., An assessment of railway capacity (2008) Transp Res Part E Logist Transp Rev, 44 (5), pp. 774-806; AECOM (2011) US and USRC Track Capacity Study, , Technical report; Burman, D., (2020) City Fined \$50K in Union Station Overcrowding Incident; Chen Feng, W., Bing, Q., Hui, Z.H., Bing, L.S., Liang, Z., Relationship analysis on station capacity and passenger flow: a case of Beijing Subway Line 1 (2009) J Transp Syst Eng Inf Technol, 9 (2), pp. 93-98; Cheung, C.Y., Lam, W.H.K., Pedestrian route choices between escalator and stairway in MTR stations (1998) J Transp Eng, 124 (3), pp. 277-285; D’Acierno, L., Botte, M., Placido, A., Caropreso, C., Montella, B., Methodology for determining dwell times consistent with passenger flows in the case of metro services (2017) Urban Rail Transit, 3 (2), pp. 73-89; Dingler, M.H., Lai, Y.C., Barkan, C.P.L., Impact of train type heterogeneity on single-track railway capacity (2009) Transp Res Record J Transp Res Board, 2117, pp. 41-49; Fruin John, J., (1971) Pedestrian Planning and Design, , Technical report; Go transit weekly cordon count (2014) Go Transit, , Technical report; Go Transit (2020a) Union station revitalization; (2020), (b; Gorman, M.F., Statistical estimation of railroad congestion delay (2009) Transp Res Part E Logist Transp Rev, 45 (3), pp. 446-456; Hänseler Flurin, S., Jeroen Heuvel van den PA, Cats O, Daamen W, Hoogendoorn Serge P (2020) A Passenger-Pedestrian Model to Assess Platform and Train Usage from Automated Data.

During the winter months in particular, warm space was a scarce commodity and the hot air vents were an ideal starting point for shelter-making, or habiter. Introducing you to Ma, Miles and a group of Polish people I will demonstrate how my informants ordered the space around the vents, personalised it with physical objects and routines and hence managed to make (temporary) homes. Conflicts both internally and with security forces rendered this process perpetually cyclical, a movement that was made even more permanent with the introduction of hostile architecture. My observations were indicative of deep fault lines in the make-up of the city space of many metropolis: between public and private space, between what home is for one person and a transit space for another, between defending the property rights of the train station and home making practices carving out shelter. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","home making; Homelessness; Paris","commodity market; homelessness; housing market; housing provision; management practice; France; Ile de France; Paris; Ville de Paris",,,,,,"The doctoral fieldwork leading to this publication was generously supported by a PhD scholarship from the Cusanuswerk in Germany.",,,"The hopeful labour of begging–homeless people’s struggles for a better life in paris Environment and Planning D, , Forthcoming; Making Better Lives–Hope, Freedom and Home-Making among people sleeping rough in Paris, , Oxford: Berghahn,.

The impact of the event on people's activity was clarified, and the relation between temporary design and permanent design was highlighted, with considerations emerging for the design of public open spaces appropriate for event interventions. The results show that during the temporary design period, the number of activities involving people in the city square increased by 40% during the day and 60% in the evening. It was also shown that each user took an 20 to 30 m longer route. The results of this study highlight the importance of employing and including temporary design in future urban design and planning projects, especially in winter cities, to optimize the placerelated attendance and activity of the residents. © 2021 The Authors","Event; Public open space; Spatial use; Temporary design; Winter cities","open space; public space; spatial analysis; urban design; urban development; urban planning; Khabarovsk [Russian Federation]; Russian Federation",,,,,"Japan Society for the Promotion of Science, KAKEN: 19K15159, JP25249082","This work was supported by JSPS KAKENHI Grant Number JP25249082, JP19K15159.

However, in practice, many urban masterplans still seem to underestimate or even ignore uncertainty. Some scholars have proposed design flexibility and adaptivity as a way to deal with uncertainties, but a formal framework has been lacking in urban design theory. Drawing upon theories of real options in finance and economics, a framework for design under conditions of uncertainty is developed. Five generic design strategies are identified, offering different flexibility options to urban design. Although such design options are currently used in practice in an intuitive way, the real options framework allows designers to cope with uncertainties in a more structured way and offers the possibility to quantify the added value of flexibility options. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",,"economics; uncertainty analysis; urban design; urban planning",,,,,,"The authors would like to thank Perspective Brussels for their permission to reprint Figure 1.",,,"Avadikyan, A., Llerena, P., A Real Options Reasoning Approach to Hybrid Vehicle Investments (2010) Technological Forecasting and Social Change, 77 (4), pp. 649-661. , and; Barton, H., Grant, M., Guise, R., (2003) Shaping Neighbourhoods: A Guide for Health, Sustainability and Vitality, , London: Spon Press; Bell, D., The Emergence of Contemporary Masterplans: Property Markets and the Value of Urban Design (2005) Journal of Urban Design, 10 (1), pp. 81-110; Braee, E., Île de Nantes—Designerly Ways of Recognition (2013) New Constellations New Ecologies, pp. 73-80. , Berman I.L., (ed), ACSA Press,. edited by.

The first is to explore the issues associated with staging events in public spaces, and to produce a typology of different event spaces. The second is to explore if and how events should be designed into parks, streets and squares and whether this might reduce some of the negative impacts and associated user conflicts. Design/methodology/approach: The paper analyses the history, drivers and effects of using public spaces as venues and examines the reciprocal relationships between events and the spaces that host them. To explain the range and dynamics of contemporary events, a typology of event spaces is developed. This typology highlights nine different types of event spaces which are differentiated by the level of public accessibility (free entry, sometimes free, paid entry), and the mobility of event audiences (static, limited mobility, mobile). Using this typology, the paper discusses ways that public spaces might be adapted to make them better suited to staging events. This discussion is illustrated by a range of examples. Findings: The paper finds that it makes practical sense to adapt some urban public spaces to make them better equipped as venues, but designing in events presents new issues and does not necessarily resolve many of the problems associated with staging events. Disputes over events are inevitable and constituent features of public spaces. Originality/value: This paper makes an original contribution by developing a new classification of event spaces and by synthesising ideas from urban design with ideas from the events literature. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Activation; Animation; Cities; Commercialisation; Design; Festivalisation; Festivals; Parks; Programming; Space; Squares; Streets",,,,,,"769478; Hawai`i Educational Research Association, HERA","This work was supported by HERA Public Spaces through the European Union's Horizon 2020 programme under grant agreement 769478.",,,"Amin, A., Collective culture and urban public space (2008) City, 12 (1), pp. 5-24; Bennett, A., Taylor, J., Woodward, I., (2014) The Festivalization of Culture, , (Eds.)

This work designs lightweight algorithms to perform stop detection, passenger flow tracking, and passenger estimation in an automated train. The on-board learning and detection algorithms are running on an edge node that is integrated with Wi-Fi sniffing technology, a GPS sensor, and an inertial measurement unit (IMU) sensor. The stop detection algorithm determines if the automated train is static at which train station based on GPS and IMU data. When the train is moving, the correlations between statistical properties extracted from Wi-Fi probes and the actual number of passengers change. Therefore, two algorithms, passenger flow tracking and passenger estimation, are designed to analyze passenger mobility. The passenger flow tracking algorithm analyzes the number of incoming and outgoing passengers in the train. The passenger estimation algorithm approximates the number of passengers inside the train based on a multi-dimensional regression model created by statistical properties extracted from different device brands. The designed prototype is deployed in an automated hanging train to conduct real-world experiments. The experimental results indicate that the proposed passenger flow tracking algorithm reduces the average errors of 62.5% and 70% compared against two existing clustering algorithms respectively. When the devices' brands are split for creating a regression model, compared with two counting-based approaches, the proposed passenger estimation algorithm results in lower errors with a mean of 3.15 and a variance of 9.29. © 2013 IEEE.","crowd mobility analytics; Cyber-physical systems; Internet-of-Things.; pervasive computing; smart cities","Automation; Global positioning system; Job analysis; Regression analysis; Signal detection; Tracking (position); Wireless local area networks (WLAN); Detection algorithm; Estimation algorithm; Inertial measurement unit; Multi dimensional; Public transport; Real world experiment; Regression model; Statistical properties; Clustering algorithms",,,,,,,,,"Wu, F.-J., Kao, Y.-F., Tseng, Y.-C., From wireless sensor networks towards cyber-physical systems (2011) Pervasive Mobile Comput., 7 (4), pp. 397-413; Wu, F.-J., A sensor-assisted emergency guiding system: Sensor-centric or user-centric?

The rising transport demand increases the congestion in railway networks and thus they become more interdependent and more complex to operate. Also, an increasing number of disruptions due to system failures as well as climate changes can be expected in the future. As a consequence, many trains are cancelled and excessively delayed, and thus, many passengers are not reaching their destinations which compromises customers need for mobility. Currently, there is a rising need to quantify impacts of disruptions and the evolution of system performance. This review paper aims to set-up a field-specific definition of resilience in railway transport and gives a comprehensive, up-to-date review of railway resilience papers. The focus is on quantitative approaches. The review analyses peer-reviewed papers in Web of Science and Scopus from January 2008 to August 2019. The results show a steady increase of the number of published papers in recent years. The review classifies resilience metrics and approaches. It has been recognised that system-based metrics tend to better capture effects on transport services and transport demand. Also, mathematical optimization shows a great potential to assess and improve resilience of railway systems. Alternatively, data-driven approaches could be potentially used for detailed ex-post analysis of past disruptions. Finally, several rising future scientific topics are identified, spanning from learning from historical data, to considering interdependent critical systems and community resilience. Practitioners can also benefit from the review to understand a common terminology, recognise possible applications for assessing and designing resilient railway transport systems. © 2020, © 2020 The Author(s).

Large gatherings in these kind of religious events require rigorous monitoring and attention. Successful organization of such events requires synchronization among officials of different public departments such as police, health, security, communication, railways etc. The railway department plays a significant role in handling huge surge of passengers and their transportation during such events. Every 12-years Kumbh Mela is organized in the city of Prayagraj (formerly Allahabad) in northern India. The Allahabad Jn. railway station experiences huge inflow and outflow of pilgrims during Kumbh Mela. The railway authorities deploy predefined crowd movement strategies and boarding procedures for smooth transportation of pilgrims. However, these strategies are outlined based on previous experiences and ground knowledge of stakeholders. The strategies followed by railway authorities are needed to be evaluated and tested for realistic assessment and possible refinement before actual deployment. Our model is able to capture and simulate the real time behaviour of entities such as pilgrims and trains by programming them as synthetic agents. This model is helpful in analyzing the time taken by a group of pilgrims to move from a designated place to their target platform and board the train. The consumed time is calculated by simulating different movement and boarding procedures including the actual plans followed by the railway authorities. In this way it is possible to assess the efficiency of their movement plans and reasons about possible refinement. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Agent Based Modelling and Simulation; Allahabad junction railway station; AnyLogic; Crowd management; Kumbh Mela festival; Pilgrims boarding procedure","Autonomous agents; Computational methods; Motion estimation; Railroad stations; Railroads; Simulation platform; Agent-based modelling and simulations; AnyLogic; Crowd managements; Kumbh Mela festival; Pilgrims boarding procedure; Railway stations; Railroad transportation",,,,,,"This Project is done as a part of research work by Abha Trivedi (Ph.D. Scholar, GIS Cell, Motilal Nehru National Institute of Technology Allahabad, Allahabad) under the guidance of Dr. Mayank Pandey (Associate Professor, Computer Science and Engineering Department, Motilal Nehru National Institute of Technology Allahabad, Prayagraj).

To reduce the risks and enhance the system resilience, this paper formulates a theoretical framework to assess the resilience of CUPSs. Resilience is defined as the ratio of preparedness to vulnerability, according to the implication of the concept. Three-level practical indicator systems were established for these two dimensions, respectively. Furthermore, a hybrid approach combining the Analytic Network Process (ANP) and the Decision-Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL) was adopted. The Chongqing West Railway Station (the Station (W)) and the Lianglukou Rail Transit Station (the Station (L)) were used for a case study. The results showed that the Chongqing West Railway Station was more resilient to risks than the Lianglukou Rail Transit Station. Therefore, the proposed theoretical framework could be applied in assessing the resilience level of CUPSs. Resilience improvement strategies can be formulated according to the assessment results. Furthermore, the practical indicators could also provide references for urban disaster management. © 2020 by the authors.

In order to understand passengers' walking-edge effect and analyze the relationship between the layout and sustainable service abilities of the train station, a heuristics-based social force model is proposed to elaborate the crowd dynamics. Several evacuation scenarios are implemented to describe the walking-edge effect in a train station with the evacuation efficiency, pedestrian flow, and crowd density map. The results show that decentralizing crowd flow can significantly increase the evacuation efficiency in different scenarios. When the exits are far away from the central axis of the railway station, the walking-edge effect has little influence on the evacuation efficiency. Obstacles can guide the movement of passengers by channelizing pedestrian flows. In addition, a wider side exit of the funnel-shaped corridors can promote walking-edge effect and decrease the pressure among a congested crowd. Besides providing a modified social force model with considering walking-edge effect, several suggestions are put forward for managers and architects of the train station in designing sustainable layouts. © 2019 by the authors.","Evacuation simulation; Pedestrian safety; Sustainable layouts; Train station; walking-edge effect","pedestrian; railway transport; sustainability; transportation",,,,,"National Office for Philosophy and Social Sciences, NPOPSS: 15AGL021","Funding: This research was funded by the National Social Science Foundation of China (grant number 15AGL021).","This research was funded by the National Social Science Foundation of China (grant number 15AGL021).",,"Alawad, H., Kaewunruen, S., Wireless sensor networks: Toward smarter railway stations (2018) Infrastructures, 3, p. 24; Xu, H., Zhang, Y., Li, H., Skitmore, M., Yang, J., Yu, F., Safety risks in rail stations: An interactive approach (2019) J.

CrowdMeter tracks the passenger's position in the station as well as identifies her/his context (e.g., waiting for a train, buying a ticket) along with her trajectory from the station's entrance to the train. Therefrom, CrowdMeter extracts novel features, based on the user's location and context, from the phone sensors. These features capture the passenger's behavior (e.g., the walking pattern) and the ambient environment characteristics (e.g., the ambient sound) that can indicate the surrounding congestion level along the passenger's route in a railway station. CrowdMeter utilizes the passengers’ contexts to show the congestion level for each area such as crowd density in passageways and the queue length of ticketing machines. Both passengers and operators can easily recognize the more and less congested areas, which helps to support proper decision making in their trips and smarter guidance of crowds. Evaluation of CrowdMeter through a field experiment in 29 different train stations in Japan shows that it can infer the congestion levels accurately, highlighting its promise as a ubiquitous travel-support service. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Congestion estimation; Railway stations; Smartphones","Decision making; Railroads; Smartphones; Ambient environment; Ambient sounds; Congestion estimation; Congestion level; Field experiment; Railway stations; Support services; Walking pattern; Railroad stations",,,,,"Google; Japan Society for the Promotion of Science, KAKEN: JP26700006, JP26220001, JP15H02690, 19H05665, 16KT0106","This work is supported in part by a Google Research Award, Egypt, JSPS KAKENHI, JapanJP26220001, JP15H02690 and JP26700006.",,,"Yamazaki, F., Asada, Y., Measurement of the congestion externality in rail commuting in the Tokyo metropolitan area (2006), Tech. rep. mimeo; Ceapa, I., Smith, C., Capra, L., Avoiding the crowds: Understanding tube station congestion patterns from trip data (2012), pp. 134-141. , Proc. of ACM SIGKDD International Workshop on Urban Computing; Handte, M., (2014), pp. 315-322. , Crowd density estimation for public transport vehicles, in: Proc. of EDBT/ICDT Workshops; Todoroki, T., Field demonstration of usefulness of the streetcar congestion information for passengers on the stop (2008), Transport policy studies’ review; Elhamshary, M., Youssef, M., Uchiyama, A., Yamaguchi, H., Higashino, T., CrowdMeter: Congestion level estimation in railway stations using smartphones (2018), pp. 1-12. , Proc. of IEEE International Conference on Pervasive Computing and Communications; http://corporate.navitime.co.jp/en/, NAVITIME Japan Co., LTD; Lathia, N., Capra, L., How smart is your smartcard?: measuring travel behaviours, perceptions, and incentives (2011), pp. 291-300. , Proc. of International Conference on Ubiquitous Computing; Xu, C., (2013), pp. 43-52. , Crowd++: Unsupervised speaker count with smartphones, in: Proc. of ACM International Joint Conference on Pervasive and Ubiquitous Computing; Kannan, P.G., Venkatagiri, S.P., Chan, M.C., Ananda, A.L., Peh, L.-S., Low cost crowd counting using audio tones (2012), pp. 155-168. , Proc. of ACM Conference on Embedded Network Sensor Systems; Weppner, J., Lukowicz, P., Bluetooth based collaborative crowd density estimation with mobile phones (2013), pp. 193-200. , IEEE International Conference on Pervasive Computing and Communications; Maekawa, Y., Uchiyama, A., Yamaguchi, H., Higashino, T., Car-level congestion and position estimation for railway trips using mobile phones (2014), pp. 939-950. , Proceedings of ACM International Joint Conference on Pervasive and Ubiquitous Computing; Kjærgaard, M.B., Wirz, M., Roggen, D., Tröster, G., Detecting pedestrian flocks by fusion of multi-modal sensors in mobile phones (2012), pp. 240-249. , Proc. of ACM Conference on Ubiquitous Computing; Chon, Y., Kim, S., Lee, S., Kim, D., Kim, Y., Cha, H., Sensing WiFi packets in the air: Practicality and implications in urban mobility monitoring (2014), pp. 189-200. , Proc. of ACM International Joint Conference on Pervasive and Ubiquitous Computing; Xi, W., Zhao, J., Li, X.-Y., Zhao, K., Tang, S., Liu, X., Jiang, Z., Electronic frog eye: counting crowd using WiFi (2014), pp. 361-369. , Proc. of International Conference on Computer Communications; Elhamshary, M., Youssef, M., Uchiyama, A., Yamaguchi, H., Higashino, T., TransitLabel: A crowd-sensing system for automatic labeling of transit stations semantics (2016), pp. 193-206. , Proc. of Annual International Conference on Mobile Systems, Applications, and Services; Wang, H., Sen, S., Elgohary, A., Farid, M., Youssef, M., Choudhury, R.R., No need to war-drive: Unsupervised indoor localization (2012), pp. 197-210. , Proc. of International Conference on Mobile Systems, Applications, and Services; Abdelnasser, H., Mohamed, R., Elgohary, A., Alzantot, M.F., Wang, H., Sen, S., Choudhury, R.R., Youssef, M., SemanticSLAM: Using environment landmarks for unsupervised indoor localization (2016) IEEE Trans.

Particular attention is given to the polychromatic visual form, not as some detached work of art, but as a collection of tiny signals of the labor, commerce and social relations unfolding below. Design/methodology/approach - For this paper, the author has deployed a methodological approach that blends scholarship and creative practice. From 2016 to 2018, the author conducted fieldwork during three trips to Mexico City, making site visits, undertaking structured observation and engaging in conversations with vendors and customers. The author also collected data available from various municipal agencies, and reportage from newspaper articles, blogs and magazines. Meanwhile, the author developed a creative practice method grounded in the production of rendered aerial views, which allowed for the identification of typologies based on the organizational logics of the street markets. Findings - The paper identifies five typologies of street market, including: the linear, the circuit, the cluster, the contour and the hybrid. The application of these typologies by street market vendors allows for the optimal exploitation of spatial allotments for buying and selling goods. In the end, the paper reveals the polychromatic markets as expressions of an assemblage aesthetic, each a variation on a theme grounded in the cumulative daily choices, desires, routines and thickly woven collaborations of working-class people in one of the world's great conurbations. Research limitations/implications - The study is based on a limited number of cases. There are currently 1,400 street markets regularly operating in Mexico City, 200 of which set up on any given day. In order to provide some depth and texture to the study, this paper only examines 15 markets falling into the five typologies identified above. Further research would help to refine these typologies, quantify the daily and quarterly transactions that take place in the markets and assess the impacts of street vending on their surroundings. Social implications - Mexico City's street markets provide employment for some 800,000 vendors, suppliers, transporters and laborers. They also provide one-fifth of all household goods purchased in the city and 40 percent of all fresh produce. And despite the conflicts that arise, they offer an associational approach to the labor of street vending, as well as crucial economic opportunities for women with children. However, it is apparent that street markets face a range of challenges that could be mitigated with supportive policies. Originality/value - While there is a small and growing literature on Mexico City's street markets, there is no work to date that examines the assemblage aesthetic that comprises their daily emergence on the landscape. Nor do any extant studies situate the aesthetic composition within the varied urban forms, social relations and labor practices that undergird the street markets. © Emerald Publishing Limited","Aesthetics; Globalization Paper type Research paper; Labour; Mexico City; Modular; Street markets; Temporary architecture",,,,,,,,,,"Aguiar, J.C., Smugglers, fayuqueros, piratas: Transitory commodities and illegality in the trade of pirated CDs in Mexico (2013) Political and Legal Anthropology Review, 36 (2), pp. 249-265; Tianguistas se apoderan de las calles del DF con anuencia de las autoridades (2004) Crónica, p. 1. , Anonymous July 31; 43% de los capitalinos compran sus alimentos en tianguis (2016) México Nueva Era, p. 1. , Anonymous August 29; Por irregularidades, impiden instalación del tianguis de Santa Cruz Meyehualco en Iztapalapa (2017) El Sol De México, p. 1. , Anonymous December 8; Bachelard, G., (1969) The Poetics of Space, , Beacon Press, New York, NY; Baurriaud, N., (1998) Esthetique Relationelle, , Les Presses Du Reel Edition, Paris; Becker, A., Müller, M.-M., The securitization of urban space and the 'rescue' of downtown Mexico City: Vision and practice (2013) Latin American Perspectives, 40 (2), pp. 77-94; Boltvinik, J., Schteingart, M., (1997) Pobreza, Condiciones De Vida Y Salud En La Ciudad De México, pp. 427-478. , El Colegio de Mexico, Distrito Federal; Bourdieu, P., (1977) Outline of a Theory of Practice, , Cambridge University Press, Cambridge; Braham, W., Color, power, velocity (2010) New Geographies 3: New Urbanisms of Color, pp. 2-7. , Doherty, G.

In these works, Tinguely engaged kinetic movement to collapse the distinction between the artwork, audience, and setting, and create interactive platforms for cultural activities that took shape as kinetic architecture. This article analyses Tinguely’s ‘culture station’ projects together for the first time, and their significance for architecture amongst the arts. It analyses them in relation to the development of movement as an operative concept in modern art and architecture, and in the discourse for a synthesis of the arts that emerged in the wake of World War II, focusing on the significance of kinetic movement in this history. It argues that the culture stations exemplify an underlying tension in the way movement was embraced as both a condition of modern experience, and as a specific quality of artistic mediums. The culture stations contribute to an understanding of how the idea for a synthesis of the arts played out beyond the immediate post-war period, and intersected with the institutionalisation of popular culture in the 1960s. As cross-disciplinary artefacts, they have ongoing resonance in relation to the changing spatio-temporal comportments of the spectator-cum-participant in art museums, and the role of institutions in shaping the relationship between art and architecture. © 2019 RIBA.",,,,,,,"University of Queensland, UQ","The research in this article was undertaken with assistance from a University of Queensland Graduate School Travel Grant, and through the ‘Art at the End of the First Machine Age’ Visiting Professor Programme of the Métamatic Research Initiative, supported by All Arts Initiative and Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam.",,,"Ockman, J., A Plastic Epic: The Synthesis of the Arts Discourse in France in the Mid-Twentieth Century (2007) Architecture + Art: New Visions, New Strategies, pp. 30-61. , in Eeva-Liisa Pelkonen and Esa Laaksonen eds., Helsinki: Alvar Aalto Academy; Bitterman, E., (1952) Art in Modern Architecture, , New York: Reinhold; Damaz, P., (1956) Art in European Architecture: Synthesis Des Arts, , New York: Renhold; Moulis, A., (2001) Drawing Experience, , PhD diss., University of Queensland; Giedion, S., (2008) Space, Time and Architecture: The Growth of a New Tradition, p. 529. , 5th ed.

The data for analyses; pedestrian hourly volume and pedestrian walking speed in this study was extracted from the CCTV video footage at the train station in KLCC. The findings show the walking speed at the study area can be considered as fast with the highest walking speed was 1.68m/s during the afternoon peak hour and the slowest walking speed was 0.98m/s during the morning peak hour. The study area was divided into several segments in order to simulate the pedestrian density by using VISWALK. Pedestrian density was highest during the evening peak hours. The study also found that the pedestrian tended to walk in oblique movement to avoid collision with other pedestrian in the crowd during the peak hours.

Architectural design and modes of egress are critical in an emergency. Flocking describes a certain collective behavior where agents are brought together in groups and move as a cohesive unit from place to place. Collective behavior may be observed in microscopic as well as macroscopic environments. Crowd modeling incorporates the study of human behavior, mathematical modeling, and molecular or fluid dynamics. The simulation of agents and their movement in the built environment is beneficial for design professionals, scientists, and engineers. Human behavior in panic situations is notably similar to fluids and molecules. The objective of this researchwas to evaluate themovement of agents in buildings using discrete dynamic simulation. We used a novel discrete molecular dynamics technique to simulate the evacuation of agents in panic situations. Various adaptive geometric configurations were analyzed for improved crowd flow. Kinetic walls were modeled in order to evaluate design optimization as it relates to rates of egression. This research proposes the use of kinetic walls to improve safety and efficiency during an emergency evacuation. Adaptive geometric configurations show improvements over the conventional design framework. © 2019 by the authors.","Adaptive design; Collective behavior; Discrete molecular dynamics; Egress; Energy efficiency; Kinetic architecture; Sustainability",,,,,,"University of Southern California, USC","Acknowledgments: The research for this paper was made possible by a partial support from the Gesundheit Family and Architectural Guild Graduate Traveling Fellowship and the University of Southern California.",,,"Megahed, N.A., Understanding Kinetic Architecture: Typology, Classification, and Design Strategy (2017) Archit.

However, a convergence is lacking in these experiences, methods, and tactics, which raises a need for providing a convergent approach in this regard. In this paper, it is going to propose such a model of flexibility. To do this, it is first reviewed the general concepts of flexibility, and provide a short review of its history and its main executional tactics. It is then divided its main tactics into eight main groups of: ‘open plan’, ‘pre-fabricated modules’, ‘similar spaces’, ‘extendable unit᾽, ‘attachment and detachment of adjacent units’, ‘common space between adjacent units’, ‘portable walls’, and ‘retractable furniture in a multifunctional space’. Analyzing these tactics, it is extracted the three fundamental principles of flexibility: ‘soft connection’, ‘diversity and multiplicity of spaces’, and ‘multifunctional space’. Accordingly, this paper proposes a concise rule for flexibility as: ‘soft connections between spaces’ which implies to the three principles if some special attentions are paid. Although the rule seems to be simple, the paper argumentations show that paying attention to what it implies, can produce much more flexible spaces than what is created generally. At the same time, new creative ideas along supported by new emerging technologies can enrich these simple solutions extensively. © 2018 The Author(s).","Architectural flexibility; Flexibility history; Flexibility principles; Flexibility tactics; Multifunctional space; The soft connection","architectural design; design method; historical perspective; space use; structural component",,,,,,,,,"Alexander, C., (2002) The Nature of Order-Book One, , Berkeley: The Center for Environmental Structure; Alexander, C., (2002) The Nature of Order-Book Two, , Berkeley: The Center for Environmental Structure; Alexander, C., Ishikawa, S., Silverstein, M., (1977) A Pattern Language, , New York: Oxford University Press; Bentley, I., Alcock, A., Murrain, P., McGlynn, S., Smith, G., (1985) Responsive Environments, , London: The Architectural Press; Capon, D.S., (1999) Architectural Theory-Volume One, , U.K.: John Wiley; Crinson, M., (2012) Stirling and Gowan: Architecture from Austerity to Affluence, , Paul Mellon Centre BA; Einifar, A., A model to analyze residential spaces: Based on flexible criteria of traditional housing (2003) Journal of Fine Arts, 13, pp. 64-77; Ellin, N., (2006) Integral Urbanism, , New York: Routledge; Gao, A., (2012) 100 Home Design Principles, , London: Design Media Publishing Limited; Gardiner, S., (2002) The House: Its Origins and Evolution, , U.K.: Ivan R.

The article critically examines this concept, arguing that the temporary use of space should be analysed as part of the urban development process with its temporal and spatial fluctuations and its multivalent outcomes. It investigates the production of empty space and the temporary use of space as a space of opportunity and a flexible method of production. By drawing on the case of Chesterfield House in London, in the context of the British response to the global financial crisis, the temporary use of space is shown to be a moment in a complex process, offering some opportunities, but also revealing the brevity of this moment and the precarity of its users. Beyond the realm of necessity, it may be transformed into a cultural choice, a lubricant of urban development and a medium of social change, signifying a space of opportunity for some and vulnerability for others. © 2017, © Urban Studies Journal Limited 2017.","flexibility;

As functional ornament, they commonly remain outside the traditional scope  and canon of architecture, yet their spatial deployment demands (re)consideration. This research explores an architectural history of curtain and their “hidden” use in modernism. The inclusion and subsequent erasure of these textiles occurred in tandem with the proliferation of the free plan, the free fac¸ade and the curtain wall. The following essay attempts to highlight the pivotal role of curtains beyond lighting control and client demands for privacy, but as a soft architecture of flexible programming. Through architectural drawings, details and documented photos, key architectural projects-including Mies van der Rohe's Barcelona Pavilion (1925)-are examined to understand the role of curtains in early 20th-century designs. Whether the initial parti or the result of postoccupancy demands, curtains were necessary for a functional architecture of transparency. “Curtain-as-Wall” further considers how the modernist curtain evolved into unconventional contemporary variations, such as SANAA's Glass Pavilion (2010) or Inside Outside's Kunsthal Rotterdam commission (1999), and other 21st-century examples. Unlike their predecessors, the translation of these new curtains are integrated into the architectural drawings as a crucial project component. The essay seeks to reclaim curtains as an alternative strategy in architectural design. It further demonstrates that curtains are also codified with identity politics and semantics, much like building elements, and aims to blur the disciplinary boundaries between architecture and interior design. © 2018 INFORMA UK LIMITED, TRADING AS TAYLOR and.FRANCIS GROUP.","Architecture; Curtain; Curtain wall; Gender; Interior design; Modernism; Textiles",,,,,,,,,,"The wallpaper and I are fighting a duel to the death.

A thorough understanding of kinetic systems that are relevant to architecture and their usage is important, because it enables architects to think about the major aspects of kinetics and explore their potential for architectural applications. In this context, the research presents a methodology for the definition and classification of different terms, concepts, and approaches in kinetic architecture. Moreover, it develops a framework of design strategies to identify different kinetic phases based on the main issues concerning the design, construction, and maintenance. This demonstrates how the process of designing kinetic architecture can effectively predict the challenges and problems before the actual kinetic systems are constructed and installed in the buildings. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Architecture; classification; design; dynamic; kinetic; strategy; typology","Architecture; Classification (of information); Design; Dynamics; Conceptual frameworks; Design strategies; Kinetic architectures; Kinetic systems; strategy; typology; Kinetics",,,,,,,,,"Alkhayyat, J., (2013), Design strategy for adaptive kinetic patterns: Creating a generative design for dynamic solar shading systems (M.Sc. thesis).

Despite recent methodological progress in the development of simulation tools for predicting crowd egress and evacuation, little is known based on empirical data about the underlying rules that govern exit wayfinding of pedestrians in multi-exit places. Particularly, fundamental differences between behavioural features of emergency and non-emergency egress have not been fully explored by previous studies. Stated-choice data was collected in face-to-face interviews with passengers as they exited a major railway station in Melbourne. Participants were asked what exit decision they would have made given certain hypothetical scenarios at that same station. Econometric models (error-component mixed logit) were developed to quantify the way passengers evaluate and prioritise various contributing factors while accommodating the potential decision heterogeneity. These factors include distance, crowding, visibility of exits, proximity of the exits to their destination, impact of other passengers’ decisions; and spatial distribution of exits. Key findings of our modelling suggest that (1) for nonemergency egress, proximity of the exit points to passenger's destination is a dominant factor although not the sole determinant. (2) In an emergency, passengers place a much higher priority on avoiding crowded exits compared to non-emergency situations. (3) Directional flows of pedestrians do not significantly impact on decisions made in a normal egress. (4) In an emergency evacuation, directional flows are considered as a negative utility factor by majority of individuals, although the perception of this factor is highly heterogeneous and also depends on the visibility of the exits targeted by the flow. The proposed static models can be incorporated with a broad range of crowd simulation methods as alternatives for heuristic modeller-defined exit choice rules. They accommodate the dissimilarities of egress behaviour between emergencies and non-emergencies, thereby enabling planners to conduct virtual simulations under either scenario. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Crowd management; Discrete choice analysis; Econometric modelling; Emergency evacuation; Error-component mixed logit; Evacuation planning; Public transport stations; Safety; Stated choice methods; Survey methods","Heuristic methods; Crowd managements; Discrete choice analysis; Econometric modelling; Emergency evacuation; Error components; Error-component mixed logit; Evacuation planning; Mixed logit; Public transport; Public transport station; Stated choice methods; Survey methods; Visibility",,,,,"Department of Economic Development, Jobs, Transport and Resources, State Government of Victoria, DEDJTR: LP120200361; Department of Economic Development, Jobs, Transport and Resources, DSDBI","The financial support of Public Transport Victoria (PTV) and Department of Economic Development, Jobs, Transport and Resources (DEDJTR) for this research (Arc Linkage project LP120200361 ) is highly acknowledged.",,,"Abdelghany, A., Abdelghany, K., Mahmassani, H., Al-Ahmadi, H., Alhalabi, W., Modeling the evacuation of large-scale crowded pedestrian facilities (2010) Transp.

It consists of two parts. A dynamic demand estimator allows to obtain time-dependent pedestrian origin-destination demand within walking facilities. Using that demand, a traffic assignment model describes the propagation of pedestrians through the station, providing an estimate of prevalent traffic conditions in terms of flow, walking times, speed and density. The corresponding level-of-service of the facilities can be directly obtained. The framework is discussed at the example of Lausanne railway station. For this train station, a rich set of data sources including travel surveys, pedestrian counts and trajectories has been collected in collaboration with the Swiss Federal Railways. Results show a good performance of the framework. To underline its practical applicability, a six-step planning guideline is presented that can be used to design and optimize rail access facilities for new or existing train stations. In the long term, the framework may also be used for crowd management, involving real-time monitoring and control of pedestrian flows. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.",,"Railroad transportation; Railroads; Crowd managements; Origin destination; Planning guidelines; Real time monitoring; Swiss federal railways; Traffic assignment models; Traffic conditions; Walking facilities; Traffic control; design; guideline; modeling; pedestrian; railway transport; traffic management; train; transportation planning; travel demand; walking; Switzerland",,,,,"Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Förderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung, SNF: 200021-141099","We thank Bilal Farooq, Nicholas Molyneaux, Marija Nikolić and Michaël Thémans for their contributions.

This results in a transient public space, fluid and continuously changing, which offers a new perspective on openness and functioning of public space in urban China. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","Guangzhou; Migrants; Public order; Public space; Street vendors; Urban China","governance approach; migrant worker; police force; public space; retailing; security; China; Guangdong; Guangzhou",,,,,,,,,"Bhowmik, S., Street vendors in Asia: a review (2005) Economic and Political Weekly, 22-23, pp. 2256-2264; Bork, T., Tomba, L., Etzold, B., Gransow, B., Suda, K., Flock, R., Theorizing the socio-spatial dialectic and the politics of transient urban spaces (2014) Population, Space and Place; Bouttonet, T., From local control to globalized citizenship.

The proposed approach follows the Sense-Plan-Act paradigm comprised of a model for visual attention, navigation behaviour and pedestrian movement. Stochastic features of perception are incorporated to enhance generality and diversity of the developed wayfinding simulation to reflect a variety of behaviours. The validity of the proposed approach was evaluated based on empirical data collected through wayfinding experiments with 20 participants in an immersive virtual reality environment using a life-sized 3D replica of Vienna's new central railway station. The results show that the developed cognitive agent-based simulation provides a further contribution to the simulation of human wayfinding and subsequently a further step to an effective evaluation tool for the planning of wayfinding and signage. © Copyright 2016 DDSS.","Agentbased simulation; Cognition; Computer aided evaluation; Signage system; Virtual reality; Visual attention modelling; Wayfinding","Air navigation; Artificial intelligence; Behavioral research; Cognitive systems; Intelligent agents; Stochastic systems; Urban planning; Virtual reality; Agent based simulation; Cognition; Computer aided; Signage system; Visual Attention; Way-finding; Decision support systems",,,,,,,,,"Arthur, P., Passini, R., (1990) 1-2-3 Evaluation and Design Guide to Wayfinding, , Technical Report, Public Works Canada; Bauer, D., Schneckenburger, J., Settgast, V., Millonig, A., Gartner, G., Hands free steering in a virtual world for the evaluation of guidance systems in pedestrian infrastructures: Design and validation (2013) Transportation Research Board 92nd Annual Meeting, , Presented at the; Bierlaire, M., Robin, T., Pedestrians choices (2010) Pedestrian Behaviour: Models, Data Collection and Applications, pp. 1-26. , H.

Observation experiments were conducted to analyze the process of passengers catching trains and leaving the station, through which, the phenomena of lane changing and dislocation were found in a straight channel, and seven categories of baggage were also identified in the crowd. Analysis shows that personal speed would rise as the increasing size of the baggage. A modified lattice gas model focus on the passengers carrying baggage was further built to study passengers movement characteristics. Using this model, the effect of pause probability of passengers and the effect of channel width on movement efficiency were analyzed, according to which, a management strategy to promote the flow rate of crowd in railway station was proposed. This study may be useful to study on evacuation of the railway station, control of the passengers and formulate pre-proposal on emergency evacuation. © 2015 World Scientific Publishing Company.","baggage; Lattice gas model; Movement characteristic; optimization; partition line",,,,,,"14R21422200; 51178445, 51308526, 71473207",,,,"Helbing, D., Farkas, I., Vicsek, T., (2000) Nature, 407, p. 487; Kuang, H., Tao, S., Dai, S., Li, X., (2009) Int.

The resilience of these ""output"" areas is low. The lack of resilience is mainly caused by the inflexibility in these areas where existing buildings, infrastructure, and public space cannot be moved when deemed necessary. In this article, a new vision for the city is proposed in which the locations of these objects are flexible and, as a result, the resilience is higher: a Dismantable City. Currently, the development of this sort of city is constrained by technical, social, and regulatory practice. However, the perspective of a Dismantable City is worthwhile because it is able to deal with sudden, surprising, and unprecedented climate impacts. Through self-organizing processes the city becomes adjustable and its objects mobile. This allows the city to configure itself according to environmental demands. The city is then able to withstand or even anticipate floods, heat waves, droughts, or bushfires. Adjustability can be found in several directions: creating multiple layers for urban activities (multi-layer urbanism), easing the way objects are constructed (light urbanism), or re-using abandoned spaces (transformable urbanism). © 2014 by the authors. licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.","Adaptation; Adaptive capacity; Dismantable City; Light urbanism; Resilience; Urban design; Urban metabolism",,,,,,,,,,"Walker, B., Holling, C.S., Carpenter, S.R., Kinzig, A., Resilience, adaptability and transformability in social-economic systems, , http://www.ecologyandsociety.org/vol9/iss2/art5/, Ecol.

The question I will address in the paper is whether it is possible for the responsive components of architecture to become a poetically expressive part of the building, and if so why this result has so rarely been achieved in contemporary and recent built work. The history of attitudes to- ward obsolescence in buildings is investigated as one explanation for the rarity of examples like the one considered here that successfully overcomes the rapid obsolescence of responsive components and makes these elements an integral part of the work of architecture. In conclusion I identify strategies for the design of responsive components as poetically expressive elements of architecture. © 2014 Archnet-IJAR, International Journal of Architectural Research.","Archigram; High Tech architecture; obsolescence; Responsive architecture",,,,,,,,,,"Abramson, D.M., Obsolescence and the Fate of Zlin.

It explores the social and spatial implications of new lifestyles, values, attitudes to nature and sustainability, and the models for future city life and the patterns of urban open space that might accommodate these. One vital role that urban parks play is providing space for the expression of diversity, both personal and cultural; this raises issues of democratic provision for and access to public open space. It suggests, inter alia, that the role of the urban street as public space may need to be re-thought. The social and cultural values of open space include attitudes towards nature and the desire for contact with it; contemporary understandings of ecology offer new insights into ways to serve both human needs and the broader ecological framework of urban open space structures. It has been suggested that the urbanity of public open space is threatened by the increase in 'virtual' transactions, obviating the need for real, social interaction, but there is also evidence that use of new communications technology can increase and enhance use of public open space; this may include engagement in the productive aspect of our landscape. A more flexible approach to open space definition and usage is proposed, recognising 'loose-fit' landscapes which allow opportunities for the socially marginalised and the ecologically shifting within a dynamic framework of urban structures and networks. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

A new technique is proposed which is able to estimate densities ranging from very low to very high concentration of people, which is a difficult problem because in a crowd only parts of people's body appear. The new technique is based on the differences of texture patterns of the images of crowds. Images of low density crowds tend to present coarse textures, while images of dense crowds tend to present fine textures. The image pixels are classified in different texture classes and statistics of such classes are used to estimate the number of people. The texture classification and the estimation of people density are carried out by means of self organising neural networks.
